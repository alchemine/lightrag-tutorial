GraphRAG는 이러한 맥락 인식이 부족하여, 다양한 엔티티 간의 복잡한 관계를 제대로 처리하지 못할 수 있습니다. \n\n#### 4. 데이터 구조\nLightRAG는 그래프 기반 텍스트 인덱싱을 사용하여 데이터를 구조화하며, 이는 데이터의 복잡한 관계를 효과적으로 관리하고 효율적인 검색을 가능케 합니다. GraphRAG는 이러한 접근 방식을 활용하지 않아 성능이 제한적일 수 있습니다.\n\n이러한 차이점들은 LightRAG가 더욱 효율적이고 신뢰성 높은 결과를 제공하는 이유를 설명합니다. GraohRAG는 기존의 전통적인 평가 방법에 의존하여 포괄적이고 다양한 응답을 생성하는 데 한계가 있는 반면, LightRAG는 최신 기술을 통합하여 더 나은 성능을 보여줍니다.",
